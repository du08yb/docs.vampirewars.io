# Wars and Extinction

The vampire clans had different views for their survival and the clash between them intensified, fighting in gruesome battles. The conflict between them weakened the Runes' protection. Rituals were still kept, the cycle was still unbreakable, but the thriving was fading, hunger got incontrolable, judgement was blurred and conflict only divided them as a species.They were prone to get discovered by the humans and that would eventually get all of them killed. 

For centuries, humans captured, killed and imprisoned vampires. The Ancient ones that couldnâ€™t be killed were kept in underground prisons where they slept and slept in a hibernation state for years. 

On April 12, 1910, in a small city in Japan, during a great earthquake, one of the Runes was discovered while people searched for survivors. Little did they know what it was and they removed it from the ground. Runes deactivated. Vampire immortality halted and all of them died by old age in the following years. Except for the Ancients that fell asleep in the underground prisons. 


Vampires were forgotten, only the myths and stories remained.
