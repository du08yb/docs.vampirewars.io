# The Humans

They evolved from apelike ancestors  millions of years ago. Over hundreds of thousands of years humanity evolved and eventually met their predators.   

They learned about the discrete species, accepted their role in the trophic chain and, in secret groups, with the same discretion, they fought them. Because vampires always hid in the dark, it was nearly impossible to prove their existence. The encounters always became stories, myths and only a small group of people were aware of their existence.
 
They were frightened by the vampires being superior creatures and they did everything they could to fight them. They eventually started to imprison and kill vampires, the humans were cunning, they searched for their lairs and attacked the vampires at day.
